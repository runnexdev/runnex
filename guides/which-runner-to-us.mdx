## Which Runner Should I Use?

Selecting the right runner for your CI/CD pipeline is crucial for balancing
build times and costs. To make an informed decision, you can leverage the
built-in matrix feature in GitHub Actions, which allows you to test your
workflow on multiple runners simultaneously.

### Using the Matrix Feature

The matrix feature in GitHub Actions enables you to run a job with different
configurations, specified as a matrix of key-value pairs. In this case, we'll
use the `runs-on` key to compare the performance of different BuildJet runners.

### Example Configuration

To use the matrix feature, modify your GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g.,
`main.yml` or a similar file in the `.github/workflows` directory) as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: true # In case one of the jobs fails, the other jobs will be cancelled
      matrix:
        runs-on: [runnex-2vcpu-ubuntu-2404, runnex-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404, runnex-8vcpu-ubuntu-2404, runnex-16vcpu-ubuntu-2404]
    name: Test - ${{matrix.runs-on}}
    runs-on: ${{matrix.runs-on}}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      ...
```
