Runnex leverages GitHub organization synchronization to manage and streamline
access control. By integrating with your GitHub organization, we ensure that all
members within your organization can seamlessly view and interact with Runnex.

This synchronization means that any user who is part of your GitHub organization
will automatically have access to Runnex, eliminating the need for manual user
management. This approach not only simplifies the onboarding process but also
ensures that access permissions are always up-to-date with your GitHub
organization structure.

To get started, ensure that your GitHub organization is properly linked with
Runnex. Once linked, all members of your GitHub organization will be able to
view and utilize Runnex without any additional setup.
