## Unlimited Concurrency

Runnex has no concurrency limits, allowing you to run as many simultaneous jobs
as needed. Your CI pipelines will never be delayed by job queuing, regardless of
how many concurrent jobs your organization is running. We deliver a true
serverless CI experience with instant job execution.

## Instant Compute Access

All Runnex runner configurations (from 1 to 32 vCPUs) are instantly available
when you need them. This enables you to:

- Parallelize test suites for faster builds
- Scale deployments without bottlenecks
- Access high-powered runners immediately

Unlike GitHub's hosted runners where you may wait minutes for larger instances,
Runnex provides instant access to compute resources of any size. This eliminates
queuing delays that can slow down your CI/CD pipelines.
