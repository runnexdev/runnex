## Images

### Base Image and Compatibility

Our runners use GitHub Actions runner images as their foundation, ensuring:

- 100% compatibility with GitHub Actions workflows
- Extensive pre-installed software packages
- Regular security updates and patches

For a detailed list of pre-installed software, visit the official
[actions/runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) repository.

### Image Update Policy

We maintain a strict update schedule to keep runners secure and up-to-date:

- Automatic synchronization with GitHub's official images
- Updates typically deployed within 4 hours of release
- Priority given to security patches and critical updates
- Zero-downtime rolling updates across our fleet

### Custom Image Support

While we currently don't support custom images, our standard images are
carefully curated to support common CI/CD scenarios. Our roadmap includes:

- Evaluating custom image support based on user feedback
- Potential future support for organization-specific images
- Focus on maintaining optimal performance and security
