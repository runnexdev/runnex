## Cost Breakdown

You can find the cost breakdown for each runner on the [pricing
page](https://runnex.dev/pricing).

## Free Minutes

Every organization receives 4,000 free x64 2vCPU minutes per month. These
minutes can be used with any runner configuration, with consumption rates
scaling based on vCPU count:

- 4vCPU runners consume minutes at 2x rate (10 minutes = 20 2vCPU minutes)
- 8vCPU runners consume minutes at 4x rate (10 minutes = 40 2vCPU minutes)
- And so on proportionally for higher vCPU counts
