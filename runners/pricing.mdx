## Cost Breakdown

You can find the cost breakdown for each runner on the [pricing
page](https://runnex.dev/pricing).

## Free Minutes

Every organization receives 4,000 mins of a vCPU per month. These minutes can be
used with any runner configuration, with consumption rates scaling based on vCPU
count:

- 2vCPU runners consume minutes at 2x rate (10 minutes = 20 vCPU minutes)
- 8vCPU runners consume minutes at 4x rate (10 minutes = 40 vCPU minutes)
- And so on proportionally for higher vCPU counts
