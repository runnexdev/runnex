## Compliance

### Is Runnex SOC2 Compliant?

Runnex is not yet SOC2 compliant, but we plan to start the process this year.
While we cannot provide a specific timeline, please email us at hi@runnex.dev to
express your interest, and we will notify you when we achieve SOC2 compliance.

## Security Measures

### Data Isolation and Protection

Runnex uses virtual machines (VMs) to securely isolate your data from other
users. Specifically, we use KVM, a trusted VM technology built into the Linux
kernel and utilized by millions of developers worldwide. We also implement
strict rules around authentication, encryption, and other security measures to
prevent unauthorized access to our systems.

### Github Runner One-Time Token Authentication

To authenticate GitHub's self-hosted runners and ensure secure workflow
execution, Runnex uses [one-time
tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-just-in-time-runners)
for each job. These tokens are valid only for a single execution and are
automatically removed from the repository, organization, or enterprise
afterward, minimizing security exposure.

### Trusting Runnex with Your Data

To protect your data, Runnex employs several security measures:

- Your data is stored on our secure servers
- All communication is encrypted
- Access to our servers is strictly controlled and audited
- Your code is never saved on our servers after a job is completed

We pledge to keep your code secret and not access it ourselves. Your code will
never be sold, and we understand that earning your trust is an ongoing process.

### Data Separation from Other Users

Our use of KVM-based virtual machines ensures that your data remains separate
from other users' data. Our strict security measures prevent unauthorized
individuals from observing or accessing your data.

### Log Retention

We retain metadata logs containing information about CI jobs, including the
initiator, start time, duration, and selected hardware. This data helps us
understand our business performance over time.

### Data Storage After Job Completion

We do not store your code and secrets after a job is completed.

### GitHub App Permissions and Visibility

Runnex requires specific GitHub app permissions to function properly and provide
seamless CI/CD integration. Our GitHub app needs read and write access to:

- Actions
- Workflows
- Code
- Pull requests
- Checks
- Self-hosted runners

These permissions allow us to properly execute workflows and provide debugging
support when needed.

When a job is triggered through events like `push`, `pull_request`, or
`workflow_dispatch`, our control plane receives a webhook from GitHub containing
essential metadata:

- Repository name
- Sender information
- Workflow name
- Job name

Upon job completion, we receive a final webhook with:

- Job status
- Status of each step
- Step names
- Duration of each step

This information helps us monitor job execution and provide support when needed,
while maintaining our commitment to data privacy and security.
